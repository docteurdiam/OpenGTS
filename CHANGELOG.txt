- CHG: The runtime config property "PasswordHandler.class" is now commented by 
       default.  This property was set to "md5" which creates MD5 checksum encoded
       passwords to be set in the database, instead of clear-text password.  
       Commenting this propery will again allow clear text passwords into the
       'password' field of the Account and User tables, but those that have MD5
       encoded passwords will need to be reset.

       show the last location within the specified date range.  The update "Last" 
       button display is controlled by the "trackMap.showUpdateLast" property in the
       file 'private.xml'. (This replaces the "trackMap.showLastLocation" feature)
- FIX: Fixed overflow indicator condition on reports when the number of displayed
       data records would exceed the maximum allowed records as specified in the
       'reports.xml' file.

Version 1.9.8 [2008/09/12]
- NEW: Added new MaprProvider properties "iconSelector.fleet.legend" and
       "iconSelector.legend" to provide the ability to add an icon 'legend' to the
       TrackMap page.  This legend is specified as html in the specific MapProvider
       in the 'private.xml' file, and is currently not separately localizable.  Any
       desired localization must occur in the 'private.xml' file within the icon
       legend properties.
- NEW: The Timezone selection can be hidden from the TrackMap page via the Domain
       property "trackMap.showTimezoneSelection" in the 'private.xml' file.  The 
       default value is 'true'.
- NEW: Added new map option to zoom in and display only the last point.  The vehicle
       route is still displayed, but only the last pushpin is visible on the map.
       This feature has may have limited utility for most applications, so the 
       default is 'false'.  This feature can be enabled via the Domain property
       "trackMap.showLastLocation" in the 'private.xml' file.
- NEW: Added the ability to set the default login user name when the user field is
       left blank (previously 'admin' was the only possible default login user).
       This is set using the "DefaultLoginUser" tag in 'private.xml'.
- NEW: Added optional fields to EventData table: FLD_satelliteCount, FLD_batteryLevel

       changed to include "maximum" and "default" access level attributes.
- CHG: Added bounding-box fields ("minLatitude", "maxLatitude", "minLongitude", 
       "maxLongitude") to Geozone table, optimizing lookups. (Existing Geozones
       will need to be "re-saved" to update the 'bounding-box' information.)
- CHG: Increased maximum Geozone size to 30000 meters.
- CHG: Map "AutoUpdate" now recenters the map on updates.

       displayed to the right of the map.

Version 1.9.1 [2008/07/27]
- NEW: Added a new "Pushpins" tag to the "MapProvider" section in 'private.xml' to 
       allow overriding the pushpin icons displayed on a map.  Specific static icons
       images may be specified, or custom icon URL references may be generated on 
       the fly within the Javascript code.  Additional modifications integrated to 
       allow a 'RuleFactory' implementation to determine which pushpins are to be 
       displayed for which event types (based on an "iconSelector").
       See the Pushpins section in 'private.xml' for details.
- NEW: Included several pushpins in the 'track.war' created using the "Marker Maker"
       tool supllied by GMapLive at "http://www.gmaplive.com/marker_maker_old.php".

- NEW: The 'PageDescorations' tag in 'private.xml' is now obsolete.  This section
       in the 'private.xml' file has been replaced with a 'jsp' attribute on the
       'WebPages' and 'Page' tages which allow using a defined JSP to create the
       page look and feel.  This specified JSP file now creates the formatting and
       look-and-feel for the webpage.  The components of the webpage (menus, maps,
       reports, etc) are referenced via taglib entries within the JSP file. 
       (If you have customized PageDecorations in your existing 'private.xml' file, 
       it will be necessary to migrate these customizations to a custom .jsp file, 
       using the provided "war/track/jsp/loginSession.jsp" as a template).
- NEW: A 'distance' ruler has been added to the Microsoft Virtual Earth map. Right-
       click and drag to view the 'distance' ruler.  Eventually, a similar feature
       will be added to the other map providers as well.

       separate utility links in the UI for a specific Device.
- FIX: Fixed problem preventing device groups from being set properly for a User.
- FIX: Added additional "don't cache" commands to the interactions with MIcrosoft 
       Internet Explorer to prevent it from attempting to cache page and map point 
       results.

Version 1.8.4 [2008/07/08]
